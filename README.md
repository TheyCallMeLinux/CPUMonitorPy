# CPUMonitorPy
Provides a lightweight real-time CPU monitoring tool with a terminal-based UI.

## It tracks:

* CPU usage (live progress bar, averages, peaks)
* CPU temperature (with warning/critical thresholds)
* CPU frequency
* System load averages

At the end of a monitoring session, it shows a summary report and optionally allows you to save collected data (CSV format)
